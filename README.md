## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This repository documents my work from **UN5550: Introduction to Data Science**, a graduate-level course I completed at **Michigan Technological University** in Fall 2024. The class was taught by Professor **Laura E. Brown** and provided a comprehensive foundation in data science concepts, tools, and techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

Course content was based on **Introduction to Data Science: A Python Approach to Concepts, Techniques and Applications by L. Igual and S. SeguÃ­**, and emphasized practical skill development through hands-on labs and project assignments.
